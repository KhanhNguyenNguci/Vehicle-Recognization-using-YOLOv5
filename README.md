# Objectives
Vehicle Recognization using YOLOv5.

<a id="getting-started"></a>

## Application Description
1. Using Deep Learning to recognize and count the number of vehicles. This can be used to count traffic and provide data for urban planners to address traffic congestion.
2. Research YOLOv5 framework and use it to build a model for recognization.
3. The training data consists of 930 pre-labeled images, with two labels: cars and trucks.
